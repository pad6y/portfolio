I have designed it to showcase what I have learned from all the courses on Udemy and from various sources on-line. The site is desktop version first, however I made sure its mobile responsive. </div><div class="mt-6"> This web site is like a scrap book, where I&#39;m testing and experimenting. This site is created from Laravel 8 Jetstream with VueJs frontend and inertiaJs to glue it all together. All the Udemy courses Ive taken didnt use this setup so I had to put to good use what I had learned with a lot of experimenting and researching to get a better understanding how it all worked together. Most of the courses used bootstrap so tailwind was a bit different. Knowing how vanilla CSS worked really helped with using tailwind for the first time! </div><div class="mt-6"> Please register to gain access to admin pages. You will be given moderator role where u can see pages but cannot access certain pages to alter or create users or posts. </div><div class="mt-6"> Please understand this is just a demo site. I&#39;m currently just too busy to implement every single feature. Happy to discuss this with you if your interested in hiring me. At the time of deploying this site I will have moved on to another project and be starting TDD course amongst other courses. </div><div class="mt-6"> If I&#39;m not a good fit currently please save this site. More projects will be published over time with different tech and will be listed in my project section of this page. Thanks for you time and hope to hear from you soon! </div>',6);const r={render:function(e,t){return(0,i.openBlock)(),(0,i.createBlock)("div",o,[a])}},n=r}}]);
