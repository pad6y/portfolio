    Hi, I'm Paddy
    <div class="mt-8">
      Thank you for checking out my website. I have designed it to showcase what
      I have learned from all the courses on Udemy and from various sources
      on-line. The site is desktop version first, however I made sure its mobile
      responsive.

      Even this web site is a experiment. This site is created from Laravel 8.
      Relatively new so most of the courses on Udemy was out of date. I also
      used my newly attained knowledge of VueJs and combined the two together.
      Using tailwind css to style it. Also a skill I learned during the creation
      of this site.
