    Hi, I'm Patrick a.k.a Paddy
    <div class="mt-8">
      Thank you for checking out my website. I have designed it to showcase what
      I have learned from all the courses on Udemy and from various sources
      on-line. The site is desktop version first, however I made sure its mobile
      responsive.

      This web site is like a scrap book, where I'm testing and experimenting.
      This site is created from Laravel 8 Jetstream with VueJs frontend and
      inertiaJs to glue it all together. All the Udemy courses Ive taken didnt
      use this setup so I had to put to good use what I had learned with a lot
      of experimenting and researching to get a better understanding how it all
      worked together. Most of the courses used bootstrap so tailwind was a bit
      different. Knowing how vanilla CSS worked really helped with using
      tailwind for the first time!
